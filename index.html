    <h2 id="protest">Nationwide Sunset Vigils to end the PATRIOT Act!</h2>
    <p>
        On Thursday, May 21st, activists in dozens of cities across the United States gathered
        at sunset outside the offices of their Senators, to send Congress a clear
        message: "Sunset the PATRIOT Act." Holding signs, tablets, and laptops, the
        people stood up for the human right to privacy and called for an end to
        mass surveillance by government agencies.

    <h2>Surveillance is censorship.</h2>
    <p>
        Supporters of mass surveillance often say "those who have nothing to
        hide have nothing to fear." This trivial argument ignores the fact that
        privacy is a human right, and that surveillance is often used politically
        to
        <a href="http://www.freepress.net/blog/2013/08/26/inevitable-end-surveillance-self-censorship" target="_blank">bully journalists and silent dissent</a>.
        A report by the U.N.
        found that when people know they're under
        surveillance, they are <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/06/internet-and-surveillance-UN-makes-the-connection" target="_blank">more likely to limit their own freedom of expression</a>,
        engaging in self-censorship for fear of government retaliation.
        In the United States, surveillance programs meant to fight terrorism
        are used to
        <a href="https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2015/03/12/fbi-appeared-use-informant-track-black-lives-matter-protest/" target="_blank">monitor and target political activists</a>,
        directly threatening our rights to free speech and free association.
        Governments want their citizens to be afraid of them.
        Surveillance is not about protecting us,
        <a href="http://blog.rubbingalcoholic.com/post/67613918393/surveillance-is-not-about-protecting-us-its" target="_blank">it's about control</a>.
    </p>
    <img src="images/censorship.jpg"/>
    <h2>Surveillance legislation in the United States</h2>
    <p>
        The United States government already has sweeping mass surveillance authority,
        and Congress is trying to pass even more. Here's a summary of the main
        authorities the government uses to engage in mass surveillance.
    </p>
    <h3 id="usaf">• The USA Freedom Act</h3>
    <p>
        Congress recently passed the
        <a href="https://www.usafreedom.fail" target="_blank">USA Freedom Act</a>, a so-called surveillance reform
        bill that was initially hyped as an end to NSA bulk collection. But in fact,
        this bill extended key portions of the PATRIOT Act and explicitly authorized
        the NSA's phone metadata spying program, which was
        <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/05/07/us-usa-security-nsa-idUSKBN0NS1IN20150507" target="_blank">ruled illegal</a> up until the bill
        passed. The USA Freedom Act was backed by the US Intelligence Community,
        and Congress passed it without support from key privacy groups, such as
        <a href="https://www.fightforthefuture.org" target="_blank">Fight for the Future</a>,
        <a href="https://www.eff.org/" target="_blank">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a> and
        <a href="https://www.aclu.org/" target="_blank">American Civil Liberties Union</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Opponents of the USA Freedom Act argued that the NSA will
        still be able to use
        <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/114/hr2048/text/ih#link=I_107_~Q1_k_4&nearest=H5592D08FDB5A4ADB9058380404287523" target="_blank">broad search terms</a>
        to target large portions of the population, 
        and they can collect even more information from contacts “connected” to those
        targets. Companies that hand customer data over to the government are
        rewarded with
        <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/114/hr2048/text/ih#link=I_105_~T1&nearest=H3E992BAE0C0346B9B7CCAFFEF25D1A18" target="_blank">blanket immunity from lawsuits</a>,
        even when they violate their own privacy agreements with customers. The bill
        also allows the government to issue permanent gag orders on people or companies
        that receive surveillance orders.
    </p>
    <p>
        The USA Freedom Act was just recently passed. Time will tell if it
        reigns-in mass surveillance at all, but already the law is being used to
        <a href="http://consumerist.com/2015/06/12/judge-says-usa-freedom-act-may-scuttle-twitters-transparency-lawsuit/" target="_blank">potentially shut down surveillance transparency lawsuits</a>.
    </p>
    <h3 id="s702">• Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA)</h3>
    <p>
        Although much of the public debate over mass surveillance has centered around
        the phone "metadata" collection program that Edward Snowden revealed, lawmakers
        including Senator Ron Wyden of the Intelligence Committee have suggested that
        this was just 
        <a href="http://www.wyden.senate.gov/news/press-releases/wyden-udall-statement-on-reports-of-compliance-violations-made-under-nsa-collection-programs" target="_blank">the tip of the iceberg</a>.
        Under Section 702 of FISA, the NSA has been able to collect huge
        quantities of electronic communications data, including the actual content
        of emails and web browsing sessions,
        <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/05/way-nsa-uses-section-702-deeply-troubling-heres-why" target="_blank">without a warrant or any meaningful
        oversight</a>. Section 702 has allowed the NSA to tap directly into the
        Internet backbone, giving them potentially unlimited surveillance ability.
    </p>
    <img src="images/attbuilding.jpg" class="captioned"/>
    <h4>AT&T's Folsom Street backbone facility, where the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Room_641A" target="_blank">NSA tapped directly into the Internet</a>.</h4>
    <h3 id="eo1233">• Executive Order 12333</h3>
    <p>
        Issued by President Ronald Reagan in 1980,
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_12333" target="_blank">Executive Order 12333</a> has been
        used by the NSA to justify tapping directly into the cloud storage servers of
        Yahoo and Google without a warrant or civilian oversight. The NSA has also used
        EO 12333 to secretly
        <a href="http://www.dailydot.com/politics/what-is-12333-executive-order-nsa-google/" target="_blank">construct social networks of American citizens</a>.
        Unlike other legislation, executive orders are issued by the president without
        any oversight or approval from Congress. This raises serious privacy and separation
        of power questions when such authority is used to engage in mass surveillance of
        American citizens.
    </p>
    <h3 id="cispa">• CIS(P)A: The Cyber-Intelligence Sharing Act &mdash; not passed yet!</h3>
    <p>
        CISA, formerly called CISPA, is a
        <a href="https://readplaintext.com/snowden-leaks-confirm-cisa-is-a-surveillance-bill-1e21a76abbab" target="_blank">surveillance bill</a>
        that would let the government collect private user information stored by web
        companies like Facebook and Dropbox, and share it with the NSA, DEA, and FBI.
        Companies would given legal immunity for working with the government surveillance 
        authorities in ways that violate privacy laws. Thanks to outcry from privacy
        activists, Congress has tried and failed to
        pass CISA four times over the last few years, but they're trying again this
        summer. Like a zombie, this bill is hard to kill once and for all.

                    Tell Congress to reform mass surveillance by overturning Section 702
                    of FISA and Executive Order 12333. Tell them to oppose CISA, the
                    Cyber Intelligence Sharing Act. All of these laws violate our
                    privacy.

                    <strong>We'll send this petition to Congress:</strong>
                </p>
                <div class="example">
                    It's an outrage that taxpayer funds are being used to fund a fleet
                    of spy planes operated by the FBI and used to engage in mass surveillance
                    of potentially hundreds of thousands of innocent Americans. These planes
                    have been spotted over the Mall of America, where the FBI has used
                    counterterrorism authorities to investigate political protestors for the
                    #BlackLivesMatter movement. It is unacceptable to use resources meant
                    to stop terrorists to track political activists. Congress should put
                    an end to this unconstitutional violation of civil rights immediately.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Furthermore, please overturn Section 215 of the PATRIOT Act and Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. These legal rules have been twisted by government agencies to allow mass spying of U.S. citizens without a warrant or any suspicion of wrongdoing. The so-called USA FREEDOM Act would only make matters worse, by creating new legal loopholes for the NSA and law enforcement agencies to collect even more data on millions of Americans. I am calling on you to oppose the USA FREEDOM Act, let the PATRIOT Act expire, and end mass surveillance by the U.S. government.
