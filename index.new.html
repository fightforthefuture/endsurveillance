        <h3>Congress is trying to pass CISPA in July. Don't let them!</h3>
        <p>
            CISPA is a dangerous surveillance bill that would allow the government
            to access private data from services like Facebook and Gmail without
            a warrant.<br/>

            <textarea id="action_comment">Congress has begun the work of reforming mass surveillance in the United States by passing the USA Freedom Act, but significant reform is still needed. Companies should not be granted immunity for sharing customer data with the NSA in violation of their own privacy agreements. The FBI should not be able to use counterterrorism resources to spy on peaceful political activists, as has happened with their surveillance of #BlackLivesMatter protestors, and their operation of a fleet of spy airplanes scooping up cell phone activity in U.S. metropolitan areas. Clearly, your work on surveillance reform is just beginning.

Please overturn Executive Order 12333 and Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. These laws have been abused by the government to engage in the unconstitutional mass surveillance of hundreds of millions of innocent civilians.

Also, three representatives in the House have put forth amendments that would limit mass surveillance. Thomas Massie introduced an amendment that would prevent the government from weakening encryption standards. Ted Poe proposed an amendment to block the government from requiring companies to insert surveillance "backdoors" into their communications software. Jared Polis proposed an amendment to block the DEA from engaging in bulk collection under its subpoena authority. I urge you to support all of these efforts, and to take your own initiative to reign in the surveillance state.</textarea>
